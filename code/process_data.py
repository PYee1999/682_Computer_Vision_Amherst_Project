# TODO: 
# Follow these steps from "Lecture 8: Training NNs Part III"

# 1. Read and normalize data (1 time; need to save and store as matrices)
# 2. Choose architecture (ResNet, CNN, VIM Transformer)
#   2.1. Disable regularization and check if loss is correct (log-likelihood)
#   2.2. Increase regularizaiton and check if loss goes up 
#   2.3. Run small test (small batch) - No regularizer, Test to see if model can overfit on small set
#   2.4. Start training - Adjust parameters (regularizer, learning rate, etc.)
